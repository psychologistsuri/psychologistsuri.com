## Why Big Feelings Are Common

Many children with disabilities experience emotions more intensely. Their nervous systems react faster and take longer to calm down. Small problems can feel overwhelming. Changes in routine can feel frightening.

This is not a lack of discipline. It is how their brain processes stress.

## What Behavior Is Communicating

Behavior is often a child’s only way to say:
- I am tired  
- I am scared  
- I do not understand  
- This is too much  
- I need help  

When children hit, cry, refuse, or shut down, something inside them is not working well in that moment.

Punishment may stop the behavior briefly, but it does not solve the underlying problem.

## Teach Emotional Skills During Calm Moments

Children do not learn emotional regulation during meltdowns. They learn it when they are calm.

Helpful tools include:
- Naming emotions  
- Practicing deep breathing  
- Using emotion charts  
- Teaching words for frustration and fear  
- Role-playing difficult situations  

These build emotional awareness and coping skills.

## Supporting Self-Regulation

Some children need physical movement to calm their bodies before they can calm their minds.

This can include:
- Walking  
- Stretching  
- Jumping  
- Squeezing a stress ball  
- Listening to music  
- Deep pressure  

Every child is different. Notice what brings your child back to balance.

## Avoiding Power Struggles

Power struggles increase stress for both parent and child. A dysregulated child cannot reason.

When possible:
- Offer choices  
- Use simple language  
- Reduce demands during emotional overload  
- Focus on safety first  

Connection is more effective than control.

## What Progress Really Looks Like

Progress may be slow and uneven. It does not always look dramatic.

Celebrate:
- Shorter meltdowns  
- Faster recovery  
- Asking for help  
- Using one calming strategy  

These are meaningful steps forward.

## Final Thoughts

Your child does not need you to remove their emotions. They need you to help them understand and survive them.

When you stay calm and supportive, you become the emotional anchor your child can rely on.

And over time, that support builds resilience.
