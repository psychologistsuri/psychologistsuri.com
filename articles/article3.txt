## Introduction

Approximately **1 in 36 children** in the United States is diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Autism is a neurodevelopmental difference, not a disease. Many autistic children benefit from structured supports that strengthen communication, emotional regulation, and everyday life skills.

Every child on the spectrum is unique. Some need minimal assistance, while others require more intensive support. What helps most is not changing who a child is, but providing clear and consistent frameworks that reduce stress and allow skills to develop.

In the United States, behavioral therapy is designed to help children gain functional skills, reduce distress, and increase independence, while honoring individuality, family priorities, and neurodiversity.

## What Is Behavioral Therapy?

Behavioral therapy is a group of evidence-based approaches that teach skills by connecting behavior to outcomes. The most widely used model in the United States is **Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)**, alongside classroom-based and naturalistic approaches.

Behavioral therapy commonly targets:

- Communication and language
- Social interaction and play
- Emotional regulation
- Daily living and self-help skills
- Reduction of unsafe or disruptive behaviors
- Increased independence and participation

Modern behavioral therapy emphasizes:

- Positive reinforcement rather than punishment
- Teaching skills instead of suppressing behavior
- Learning through modeling, practice, and real-life situations

## How Behavioral Therapy Works

Behavioral therapy begins with understanding why a behavior happens. Trained professionals look for patterns by examining:

- What the behavior looks like
- When and where it happens
- What happens right before the behavior
- What happens right after the behavior
- What the child may be gaining or avoiding

In behavioral science, **behavior is viewed as communication**.

Examples:

- Hitting may signal overload or discomfort
- Running away may be an attempt to escape sensory stress
- Screaming may be a way to request help or express frustration

Therapy focuses on teaching safer and more effective ways to express needs. Over time, functional communication and coping skills can replace unsafe or disruptive behavior.

## Common Types of Behavioral Therapy in the United States

### 1. Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)

ABA uses structured teaching, repeated practice, and consistent reinforcement to build skills such as:

- Communication
- Academic readiness
- Self-help skills
- Emotional regulation

Modern ABA often occurs through play and everyday activities, not only through table-based drills. Goals are most meaningful when they match a child’s daily life and support long-term independence.

### 2. Positive Behavior Support (PBS)

PBS is widely used in school settings and focuses on:

- Changing environments to reduce stress and prevent escalation
- Teaching coping and self-regulation skills
- Reducing triggers and strengthening routines
- Building positive relationships and classroom belonging

### 3. Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBI)

Common models include:

- Early Start Denver Model (ESDM)
- Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT)

These approaches blend behavioral science with child-led play to support development in natural settings. Adults follow the child’s interests while intentionally building communication, social engagement, and learning readiness.

## Behavioral Therapy in United States Public Schools

In public schools, behavioral supports are commonly delivered through:

- **IEPs** (Individualized Education Programs)
- **BIPs** (Behavior Intervention Plans)
- School psychologists
- Behavior specialists
- Special educators
- Related service providers

Under the **Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)**, schools must provide appropriate supports when autism affects learning and access to education. Supports should remove barriers, reduce distress, and help students participate meaningfully in school routines.

## Examples of School-Based Program Models

School districts may provide specialized programs for autistic students. Models vary by district, but often combine academics with structured communication, social, and behavioral supports.

### Examples from publicly described programs

**New York City**

- ASD Nest
- ASD Horizon
- AIMS

These programs integrate academic learning with support for communication, social interaction, and behavior. Services are provided within public schools and tailored to different student profiles and needs.

**Arlington Public Schools, Virginia**

- Mini-MIPA
- MIPA

These programs use clear routines, step-by-step instruction, and communication-based supports to build independence, attention, and participation. Small-group instruction and structured peer interaction are often part of the program model.

## Ethical Standards and Child-Centered Practice

High-quality behavioral therapy follows ethical and child-centered standards, including:

- Respecting the child’s dignity, preferences, and autonomy
- Avoiding coercive or harmful practices
- Focusing on meaningful, functional outcomes
- Involving families through consent and collaboration
- Remaining culturally responsive and developmentally appropriate

Effective support prioritizes safety, learning, and well-being. It should not be about control.

---

## How Behavioral Therapy Helps

When implemented ethically and consistently, behavioral therapy can:

- Improve communication
- Reduce anxiety and frustration
- Strengthen social interaction
- Build independence
- Increase participation in school and daily routines

Progress is often strongest when strategies are used across settings and embedded into real life. Skills grow faster when home and school approaches align.

## Tools for Autism Support in United States Public Schools

| Area of Support | Tool or Service | What It Does | How Schools Use It |
|---|---|---|---|
| Behavior support | FBA (Functional Behavior Assessment) | Identifies what triggers behavior and what the behavior may be communicating | Used to design supports and select goals |
| Behavior support | BIP (Behavior Intervention Plan) | Provides a written plan for prevention, teaching skills, and adult responses | Implemented across classrooms and school settings |
| Communication | Speech therapy and AAC supports | Builds language, understanding, and functional communication | Added to IEP services and used during instruction |
| Structure and routines | Visual schedules and task charts | Supports transitions, routines, and independence | Used daily in classrooms and support spaces |
| Social interaction | Social skills instruction and peer supports | Builds turn-taking, conversation, and social participation | Practiced in real activities with guided feedback |
| Regulation and sensory support | Break plans, calm spaces, movement supports | Prevents overload and supports regulation | Used proactively before stress escalates |

## Conclusion

Autism does not need to be changed, but support can make daily life easier and more successful.

When behavioral therapy is respectful, individualized, and evidence-based, children can build communication, coping, and independence skills that improve participation in school and community life. Progress often appears in small moments, such as asking for help, managing a transition, or joining peers during class activities.

The goal is not to make a child different. The goal is to help a child thrive.
