## Introduction  

Working with autistic children is not about controlling behavior or forcing academic performance. It is about understanding how each child experiences the world and building a learning environment that supports communication, emotional regulation, independence, and growth.  

This article is based on my experience working with a group of seven autistic children between the ages of 7 and 10. Their disability levels ranged from mild to moderate, yet their needs were complex. Many had profound sensory sensitivities, limited speech, and significant behavioral challenges. At the same time, families expected their children to develop academic skills in reading, writing, and math. Balancing these needs required patience, structure, creativity, and teamwork.

## Understanding the Challenges  

Most students had strong sensory sensitivities to light, sound, touch, and smell. Many communicated using only one to three words. Several struggled with sitting, threw objects, hit others, or engaged in self-injurious behaviors such as biting themselves.  

These behaviors were not defiance. They were signs of frustration, fear, or unmet communication needs. When a child cannot express what they need, behavior becomes their language.

## Observing Before Teaching  

Before designing any program, I carefully observed each student to understand:  

- Their sensory needs  
- Their strengths and interests  
- Their triggers and stress signals  
- Their likes and dislikes  
- Their communication style  

No two autistic children are the same. One method does not work for all.

## Creating a Structured, Visual Classroom  

Most of my students were visual learners. I designed the classroom to include visual and sensory-based materials they could see, touch, and explore.  

My first goal was not academics — it was to improve attention span and sitting tolerance through engaging, meaningful activities.

---

## Using Visual Schedules  

I introduced visual schedules starting with what they loved and already understood, such as:  

- Breakfast time  
- Lunch time  
- Play time  
- Home time  

These routines reduced anxiety and increased trust. Once the structure was established, I added learning and task-based activities.

## Building Communication With PECS  

I introduced the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS) through one-to-one teaching. Students began by exchanging pictures across a table. Over time, distance and complexity increased using communication boards.  

Speech was always encouraged, but never forced. Positive reinforcement made communication rewarding. Gradually, students built larger picture vocabularies to express needs, choices, and emotions.

## Teaching Daily Living Skills  

We worked on Activities of Daily Living (ADL), including:  

- Eating  
- Dressing  
- Toilet training  

These were taught through repetition, visuals, and consistency. After about six months, students began showing real independence.

## Working as a Team  

Progress accelerated when parents, speech therapists, general education teachers, PE teachers, and technology staff worked together. I shared goals, demonstrated strategies, and welcomed feedback.  

Collaboration created consistency, and consistency created growth.

---

## Using Technology to Improve Communication  

Communication books were helpful but difficult to carry. I introduced tablets and iPads with picture-based folders. Students could scroll, tap, and select pictures to communicate. This system was easy, motivating, and effective.  

I also created social story videos to teach expected behavior and reduce aggression.

## Turning Behavior Into Strength  

- Running became sports.  
- Tapping became music.  
- Screaming became singing.  

Behavior is communication. When guided properly, it becomes learning.

## A Lesson From Kalidasa  

In a story about Kalidasa, gestures that appeared meaningless were understood by scholars as deep symbols. Autism is similar — what seems like disorder often holds meaning when we learn how to read it.

## Conclusion  

Every autistic child has the ability to grow. With patience, observation, and teamwork, their potential becomes visible.  

Autism does not block learning. It simply requires a different path.
