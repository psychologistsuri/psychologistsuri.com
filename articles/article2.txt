## Introduction  

When you work with autistic children, do not focus on control. Do not try to force academic results. Instead, focus on understanding. You must see how each child experiences the world. You must build a space that supports them. This environment helps them communicate. It helps them manage emotions. It helps them find independence.  

I write this article based on my time with a group of seven students. They were between the ages of 7 and 10. Their disability levels ranged from mild to moderate. But their needs were complex. Many of these students had deep sensory issues. Some spoke little or not at all. Others faced major behavior struggles.  

At the same time, their families had big hopes. They wanted their children to read. They wanted them to write. They wanted them to do math.  

To balance these needs, I had to be patient. I had to get creative.

## Understanding the Challenges  

You must understand what these students face. Most of my students felt pain from things most people ignore. Bright lights bothered them. Loud sounds hurt their ears. Certain textures felt wrong on their skin.  

Because of this, they struggled. Many used only one or two words to speak. Some were unable to sit still. They threw objects. They hit other people. Some even bit themselves to cope with the stress.  

You might look at these actions and see bad behavior. But that is wrong. These actions are not defiance. They are signs of fear. They are signs of frustration. When a child is unable to say what they need, they act out. Behavior is their language.

## Observing Before Teaching  

You have to watch before you teach. I did not start with lessons. First, I studied each student carefully. I looked for these things:  

- Their sensory needs  
- Their strengths and personal interests  
- What upsets them or causes stress  
- What they like and dislike  
- How they try to talk to me  

Every child is different. A method that works for one student will fail with another. You must adapt to them.

## Creating a Structured, Visual Classroom  

My students learned with their eyes. They were visual learners. So, I designed the room for them. I included materials they were able to see, touch, and explore.  

My first goal was not reading or math. It was focus. I needed them to sit and pay attention. We did this through fun activities. These tasks meant something to them.

## Using Visual Schedules  

I used visual schedules to lower their anxiety. We started with parts of the day they loved and understood. The schedule showed:  

- Breakfast time  
- Lunch time  
- Play time  
- Home time  

This routine helped them feel safe. It built trust between us. Once they felt safe, I added work tasks to the schedule.

## Building Communication With PECS  

I introduced the Picture Exchange Communication System. We call this PECS. I taught this one-on-one.  

The student started by handing me a picture across a table. If they gave me the picture of a cookie, they got a cookie.  

We slowly increased the distance. We made the tasks harder using communication boards.  

I always encouraged them to speak. But I never forced it. We used positive rewards to make talking feel good. Over time, they learned more pictures. They began to tell me what they needed. They shared their feelings.

## Teaching Daily Living Skills  

We worked hard on Activities of Daily Living. We focused on skills such as:  

- Eating food  
- Getting dressed  
- Using the toilet  

We taught this by doing it over and over. We used pictures to show the steps. We stayed consistent.  

It takes time. After about six months, I saw real changes. They started doing things by themselves.

## Working as a Team  

You cannot do this alone. Progress happened faster when we worked as a team. This team included parents and speech therapists. It included general education teachers and technology staff.  

I shared my goals with them. I showed them my strategies. I asked for their ideas and feedback.  

This creates consistency. Consistency leads to growth.

## Using Technology to Improve Communication  

Communication books are helpful, but they are heavy. They are hard to carry.  

I brought in tablets and iPads. We used folders with pictures on the screen. Students were able to scroll and tap a picture to make a choice.  

This system was easy to use. It motivated them.  

I also made videos about social stories. These videos taught them how to act in class. They helped stop the hitting and screaming.

## Turning Behavior Into Strength  

I looked at their habits in a new way.  

Running turned into sports.  
Tapping turned into music.  
Screaming turned into singing.  

Behavior is communication. If you guide it well, it becomes learning.

## A Lesson From Kalidasa  

Think of the story of Kalidasa. Scholars saw his odd gestures and found deep meaning in them.  

Autism is like that. It looks like disorder to some. But it holds meaning. You simply have to learn how to read it.

## Closing Thoughts  

Every autistic child is able to grow. You need patience. You need to observe. You need a team.  

When you do this, you see their true potential.  

Autism does not stop learning. It means you must take a different path.
